# Customizable AI Assistant - Tell it what to know

## Description
This project is a highly customizable AI assistant that leverages OpenAI's advanced technologies, enabling personalized interactions for virtually any topic.

The assistant uses OpenAIâ€™s APIs, including Whisper for real-time speech recognition, GPT-3.5 Turbo for context-aware response generation, and TTS (Text-to-Speech) for verbalizing responses.

It allows users to ask questions via text or voice, with responses tailored to their specific needs.

By integrating with OpenAI's assistant framework, this project offers a flexible platform that can be adapted to serve as a personal assistant across various domains.

The assistant can be configured with custom hotwords, response styles, and specialized knowledge, making it an ideal tool for personalized user experiences.

This project also complements the Voice Assistant project, allowing for seamless integration of voice-based interactions.

**Note:** The graphical interface is intentionally designed to be unattractive, just to make sure you focus on the true potential of the project. Let's just say the interface is a work in progress, but the brains behind it are top-notch!
